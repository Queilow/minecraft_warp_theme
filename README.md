# minecraft_warp_theme
My warp config to pretend writing terminal commands in Minecraft

# Installation
Place the `themes` folder from this repo inside your `~/.warp/` directory. 

You can resize the warp application and panes to fit your background image.

Install the minecraft-like monospaced font [here](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft).
